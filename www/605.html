<h2>EMR EMT AEMT Paramedic</h2>
<ol>
<li>Safety of EMS personnel is the main priority in any situation where a patient exhibits aggressive or combative behaviors and needs to be restrained.</li>
<li>Use the minimum amount of force and restraint necessary to safely accomplish patient care and transportation with regard to the patient’s dignity. Avoid unnecessary force.</li>

<li>Plan your approach and activities before restraining the patient.</li>
<li>Have one person talk to and reassure the patient throughout the restraining procedure.</li>
<li>Approach with a minimum of four persons, one assigned to each limb, all to act at the same time.</li>
<li>Initial take down may best be accomplished leaving the patient in the prone position. After restraint, the patient should be placed in a supine position.</li>
<li>Call for additional help if patient continues to struggle against restraint.</li>
<li>Restrain all 4 extremities with patient supine on stretcher.</li>
<li>Use soft restraints to prevent the patient from injuring him or herself or others.</li>
<li>A police officer or other law enforcement personnel shall always be requested to accompany a patient in the ambulance if the patient has been restrained.</li>
<li>Do not place restraints in a manner that may interfere with evaluation and treatment of the patient or in any way that may compromise patient’s respiratory effort.</li>
<li>Evaluate circulation to the extremities frequently.</li>
<li>Thoroughly document reasons for restraining the patient, the restraint method used, and results of frequent reassessment.</li>
<li>DO NOT restrain patient in a hobbled, hog-tied, or prone position. Do not sandwich patient between devices like long boards.</li>

<li>Never apply restraints near the patient’s neck or in a way that restricts breathing.</li>
<li>Never cover mouth or nose except with surgical or NRB mask with oxygen. NRB masks should not be used to prevent spitting unless oxygen is also administered.</li>
