<li><strong>NEVER</strong> simply disregard a standing order or protocol.
          <ol>
<li>These Standing Orders have been established so that EMS Personnel may provide the best care possible for our patients. Most of our patients will be covered by a single Standing Order. However, some patients may have signs and symptoms of illness and/or injury that are covered by more than one Standing Order or, in rare cases, following a Standing Order may not be in the best interest of the patient. In these cases you must be aware that combining Standing Orders may lead to medication errors, overdose, and medication incompatibility. You are expected to use your judgment and to always make decisions that are in the best interest of the patient.</li>
<li>If you use more than one standing order when treating your patient, you must document your reasoning in the NARRATIVE SECTION of the Patient Care Report.</li>
<li>If in your judgment, following a standing order is not in the best interest of the patient, CONTACT MEDICAL CONTROL regarding your treatment. Document the rationale for deviation, and the name of the physician giving the order.</li>
