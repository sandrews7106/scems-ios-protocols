<div class="container">
<h2>Paramedic</h2>
<h2>Indications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Capnography shall be used as soon as possible in conjunction with any airway management adjunct, including endotracheal, cricothyrotomy, Blind Insertion Airway Device (BIAD) or BVM.</li>
<li>Capnography is recommended to be used on all patients treated with CPAP, Magnesium, Epinephrine, and all respiratory distress, seizures, and sedative/pain medications.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ol>
<li>Attach capnography sensor to the BIAD, endotracheal tube, or oxygen delivery device.</li>
<li>Note CO₂ level and wave form changes. These will be documented on each respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or respiratory distress patient.</li>
<li>Capnography shall remain in place with the airway and be monitored throughout the prehospital care and transport.</li>
<li>Any loss of CO₂ detection or waveform indicates an airway problem and should be documented.</li>
<li>Capnography should be monitored as procedures are performed to verify or correct the airway problem.</li>
<li>Document the procedure and results on/with the Patient Care Report (PCR/EPCR).</li>
<li>In all patients with a pulse, an ETCO₂ &gt;20 is anticipated. In the post-resuscitation patient, no effort should be made to lower ETCO₂ by modification of the ventilatory rate. Further, in post-resuscitation patients without evidence of ongoing, severe bronchospasm, ventilatory rate should never be &lt;6 breaths per minute.</li>
<li>In the pulseless patient, an ETCO₂ waveform with an ETCO₂ value &gt;10 may be utilized to confirm the adequacy of an airway to include BVM and advanced devices when SpO₂ will not register.</li>
</ol>
