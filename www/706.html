<h1 class="protocol-title">706 – DELAYED OFF LOADING OF STABLE NON-EMERGENT PATIENTS IN THE ED</h1>
<div class="container">
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<ul>
<li>EMS is currently facing an increasing frequency of patient turnover being delayed in the Emergency Department due to delays in acknowledgement, assessment, and placement in the ED. These delays negatively impact the ability of EMS to maintain response capability and provide emergency response in a timely manner. This protocol provides a method to off-load non-emergent patients and return to service in a timely manner.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Paramedic</h2>
<ol>
<li>Eligible patients (patients must meet <strong>ALL</strong> of the following criteria:
          <ol type="A">
<li>Greater than 16 years old or less than 65 years old</li>
<li>Stable vital signs</li>
<li>Non-Emergent complaint</li>
<li>Patient can walk and talk</li>
<li>Patient has had neither medications nor significant interventions by EMS (minor bandaging, splinting, without Nausea/Vomiting concerns)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Procedure
          <ol type="A">
<li>Ambulance arrives in ED and notifies ED nursing staff of patient.</li>
<li>If the ED Nursing Staff has not accepted report and made efforts to offload the patient from the EMS stretcher within 20 minutes of arrival, contact EMS Supervisor.</li>
<li>EMS Supervisor again requests ED Nursing Staff to offload the EMS stretcher. If no progress is made within 15 minutes of the Supervisor’s engagement, and the patient meets all the criteria above, perform the following:
              <ol type="a">
<li>Ensure the patient’s condition is unchanged</li>
<li>Walk the patient to the triage waiting area</li>
<li>Document all contacts with ED personnel, and record names of Charge and Triage nurses</li>
<li>Denote method of patient care transfer on PCR/EPCR</li>
<li>Complete an abbreviated, hand written EMS run report to include patient demographics, complaint, vital signs and pertinent history and ensure hospital is aware of patient’s presence in the waiting room</li>
<li>Complete standard EPCR run report</li>
<li>Return to service</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In the event that a patient does not agree to be placed in the waiting room the patient has the right to refuse offload</li>
</ol>
