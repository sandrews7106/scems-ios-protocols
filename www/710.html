<h2>Indications:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Intravenous fluid or medications needed AND
    <ul>
<li>Peripheral IV cannot be established in two attempts or 90 seconds AND the patient exhibits one or more of the following:</li>
<li>Altered mental status (GCS of 8 or less)</li>
<li>Respiratory compromise (SaO2 of 80% or less following appropriate oxygen therapy, and/or respiratory rate &lt;10 or &gt;40/min)</li>
<li>Hemodynamically unstable (Systolic BP &lt;90)</li>
</ul>
<li>IV Access is preferred, however, IO may be considered prior to peripheral IV attempts in the following situations:
    <ul>
<li>Cardiac Arrest (Medical or Trauma)</li>
<li>Profound hypovolemia with altered mental status</li>
</ul>
</li></li></ul>
<h2>Contraindications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fracture of the tibia or femur (for tibia insertion) – Consider alternate tibia</li>
<li>Fracture of the humerus (for humeral head insertion) – Consider alternate humerus</li>
<li>Previous orthopedic procedures (ex.: IO within previous 24 hrs, knee replacement, shoulder replacement)</li>
<li>Infection at the insertion site</li>
<li>Significant edema</li>
<li>Excessive tissue at insertion site</li>
<li>Inability to locate landmarks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<ol>
<li>Flow rates: Due to the anatomy of the IO space you will note flow rates to be slower than those achieved with IV access</li>
<li>Ensure the administration of 10 ml rapid bolus with syringe</li>
<li>Use a pressure bag or pump for fluid challenge</li>
<li>Pain: Insertion of the IO device in conscious patients causes mild to moderate discomfort and is usually no more painful than a large bore IV. However, fluid infusion into the IO space is very painful and the following measures should be taken for conscious patients:
    <ol type="A">
<li>Prior to IO bolus or flush on a conscious adult patient, SLOWLY administer 20-50 mg of 2% lidocaine.</li>
<li>Prior to IO bolus or flush on a conscious pediatric patient, SLOWLY administer 0.5 mg/kg 2% lidocaine.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Adult patient:
    <ol type="A">
<li>Defined as a patient weighing 40 kg or greater</li>
<li>The adult needle set shall be used for adult patients</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ol>
<li>Primary Insertion Site: Tibial Plateau
    <ol type="A">
<li>If IO access is warranted, the tibia shall be the insertion site of choice if possible</li>
<li>In the cardiac arrest patient the humeral head should be the primary insertion site</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Alternate Insertion Site: Humeral Head or Medial Malleolus (adult patient only)</li>
<li>If IO access is not available via the tibial insertion site due to contraindications or inability to access the site due to patient entrapment and vascular access is imperative, the IO may be placed in the humeral head.
    <ol type="A">
<li>In the cardiac arrest patient, the humeral head should be the primary insertion site</li>
<li>Do not attempt insertion medial to the Intertubercular Groove or the Lesser Tubercle</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Pediatric Patient:
    <ol type="A">
<li>Defined as a patient weighing 3-39 kg</li>
<li>The pediatric needle set (pink or blue) shall be used for pediatric patients</li>
<li>Use the length based assessment tape to determine pediatric weight</li>
<li>The only approved site for pediatric IO insertion is the tibial plateau</li>
<li>Use appropriate size needle set for the patient. The blue needle set may be used for pediatrics (if available)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Standing Order</h2>
<ol>
<li>The EZ-IO may be used if the indications are met and no contraindications exist.</li>
<li>Precautions:
    <ol type="A">
<li>The EZ-IO is not intended for prophylactic use</li>
<li>The EZ-IO infusion system requires specific training prior to use</li>
<li>Proper identification of the insertion site is crucial.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Landmarks: Tibial Plateau
    <ol type="A">
<li>There are three important anatomical landmarks – the Patella, the Tibial Tuberosity (if present) and the Flat Aspect of the Medial Malleolus.</li>
<li>Important: The tibial tuberosity is often difficult or impossible to palpate on very young patients!</li>
<li>The traditional approach for IO insertions in small patients where the tibial tuberosity cannot be palpated is to identify the insertion site “TWO FINGER WIDTHS BELOW THE PATELLA and then medial along the flat aspect of the TIBIA”.</li>
<li>The traditional IO insertion in slightly larger patients where the tuberosity can be appreciated generally suggests “One finger width distal to the tibial tuberosity along the flat aspect of the medial tibia.”</li>
<li>The EZ-IO should be inserted two finger widths below the patella (kneecap) and one finger medial (toward the inside) to the tibial tuberosity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For the morbidly obese patient:
    <ol type="A">
<li>Consider rotating the foot to the mid-line position (foot straight up and down).</li>
<li>With the knee slightly flexed, lift the foot off the surface allowing the lower leg to “hang” dependent.</li>
<li>This maneuver may improve your ability to visualize and access the tibial insertion site.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Landmarks: Humeral Head
    <ol type="A">
<li>Place the patient in a supine position</li>
<li>Expose the shoulder and place the patient’s arm against the patient’s body.</li>
<li>Rest the elbow on the stretcher with the forearm on the abdomen. Palpate and identify the mid shaft humerus and continue palpating toward the humeral head. As you near the shoulder you will note a small protrusion. This is the base of the greater tubercle insertion site. With the opposite hand “pinch” the anterior and inferior aspects or the humeral head confirming the identification of the greater tubercle. This will ensure that you have identified the midline of the humerus itself. The inse...
    </li></ol>
</li>
<li>Landmarks: Medial Malleolus
    <ol type="A">
<li>The insertion site is two finger widths proximal to the Medial Malleolus and positioned midline on the medial shaft</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ol>
<li>Inserting the EZ-IO:
    <ol type="A">
<li>Determine that the EZ-IO is indicated</li>
<li>Ensure that no contraindications are present</li>
<li>Locate the proper insertion site</li>
<li>Clean the insertion site with alcohol</li>
<li>Prepare the EZ-IO driver and needle set</li>
<li>Stabilize the leg (or arm)</li>
<li>Position the driver at the insertion site with the needle at a 90° angle to the surface of the bone</li>
<li>Power the needle set through the skin until you feel the tip of the needle set encounter the bone. Apply firm steady pressure on the driver and power through the cortex of the bone. Stop when the needle flange touches the skin or a sudden resistance is felt. Stop on the POP. This indicates entry into the bone marrow cavity</li>
<li>Grasp the hub firmly with one hand and remove the driver from the needle set</li>
<li>While continuing to hold the hub firmly, rotate the stylet counter clockwise and remove it from the needle set. Dispose of the stylet properly in a sharps container</li>
<li>Confirm proper placement of the EZ-IO catheter tip:
        <ul>
<li>The catheter stands straight up at a 90° angle and is firmly seated in the tibia</li>
<li>Blood is sometimes visible at the tip of the stylet</li>
<li>Aspiration of a small amount of marrow with a syringe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attach a primed extension set to the hub and flush the IO space with 10 cc of Normal Saline. NO FLUSH – NO FLOW</li>
<li>If the patient is conscious, administer Lidocaine 2% 20-50 mg slowly PRIOR to the initial bolus</li>
<li>Initiate the infusion per standing orders. Use of a pressure infuser or blood pressure cuff is recommended to maintain adequate flow rates</li>
<li>Apply the wrist band and a dressing</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>NOTE</h2>
<ul>
<li>With properly documented training and equipment AEMTs are authorized to place EZ-IOs. EZ-IO should be utilized in accordance with these protocols. AEMT’s may only establish an EZ-IO if they have had specific training through the service on the device.</li>
<li>Any medication that can be administered through a peripheral IV CAN be used through an IO route.</li>
</ul>
