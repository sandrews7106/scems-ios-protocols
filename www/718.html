<div class="container">
<h2>Paramedic</h2>
<h2>Indications</h2>
<ul>
<li>The QuickTrach Emergency Airway is indicated in the urgent need for an emergency airway when the paramedic is unable to intubate or ventilate by any other means. This airway is considered a last-resort method of securing an airway. To be used on patients who are 40 kg and above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ol>
<li>With the patient supine, hyperextend the head. If spinal injury is suspected, leave head/neck in a neutral in-line position.</li>
<li>Locate the patient’s cricothyroid membrane (in the midline between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage).</li>
<li>Prep the area using aseptic technique.</li>
<li>After identifying the cricothyroid membrane, puncture the skin and membrane with a #11 blade scalpel.</li>
<li>Firmly hold the device and puncture the cricothyroid membrane at a 90-degree angle.</li>
<li>Maintain negative pressure on the syringe as the needle is advanced. The needle has entered the trachea when air readily fills the syringe.</li>
<li>Change the angle of insertion to 60 degrees and advance the device forward (dorsally) into the trachea to the level of the stopper.</li>
<li>Remove the stopper. After the stopper is removed, be careful not to advance the device further with the needle still attached.</li>
<li>Hold the needle and syringe firmly and slide only the plastic cannula along the needle into the trachea until the flange rests on the neck.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the needle and syringe.</li>
<li>Secure the cannula with the provided neck tape, apply the connecting tubing to the 15mm connection, and connect the other end to the BVM.</li>
<li>Ventilate the patient with a BVM, checking lung sounds for proper placement and working condition.</li>
<li>Control any external bleeding as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>If no aspiration of air is possible in Step 6 due to an extremely thick neck, remove the stopper and carefully insert the needle further until entry into the trachea is confirmed. Then continue with Step 7.</li>
<li>Thorough documentation of patient assessment prior to insertion, need for the QuickTrach, and procedural details is required. Any deviations from this procedure must be documented with justification.</li>
</ol>
