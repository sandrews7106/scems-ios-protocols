<h2>General Guidelines</h2>
<ol>
<li>Perform patient airway/ventilatory assessment and difficult airway assessment.</li>
<li>Identify the need for RSI.</li>
<li>Identify potential complications that could result from RSI
    <ol type="A">
<li>Assess for familial history of malignant hyperthermia (MH) if practical. If there is a history of MH, do not administer succinylcholine.</li>
<li>Assess for high probability of hypotension. If present, pretreat the patient with a bolus of 250–500 cc of IV fluid prior to induction or initiate vasopressors.</li>
<li>Assess for risk of precipitous hypoxia. If present, assure safeguards are in place to minimize apneic time, assure very strong preoxygenation prior to induction, and assure multiple plans exist to rescue hypoxia.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Brief physical exam
    <ol type="A">
<li>Neurological assessment:
        <ol type="a">
<li>LOC/GCS</li>
<li>Motor/sensory function</li>
<li>Pupil response</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Breath sounds</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Brief all personnel on primary airway plan, as well as alternative airway plan.
    <ol type="A">
<li>Assure one person is designated as an assistant and is briefed on duties.
        <ol type="a">
<li>If practical, a skilled assistant should be utilized to perform cric pressure as well as assist with external laryngeal manipulation (ELM).</li>
<li>Assure personnel can maintain manual c-spine if needed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If someone other than a Sullivan County EMS clinical crew member will be administering the medications, assure the following:
        <ol type="a">
<li>Medication administration is within his/her scope of practice</li>
<li>They are skilled at administering RSI medications and have been briefed on dosages and timing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Assure the following:
    <ol type="A">
<li>IV/IO access established</li>
<li>Attached to ECG monitor and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring (if operationally practical)</li>
<li>Attached to pulse oximetry</li>
<li>Place the patient on continuous waveform capnography via nasal cannula</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Medications may be pre-drawn into separate syringes and clearly labeled.</li>
<li>The following equipment should be checked and within arm’s reach during the procedure.
    <ol type="A">
<li>Laryngoscope handle and appropriate blades</li>
<li>Bag valve mask, attached to, and flowing oxygen</li>
<li>Suction on and ready at the patient’s head</li>
<li>Confirmation devices such as the EDD, EtCO2 monitoring</li>
<li>Appropriate sized endotracheal tube introducer (ETTI aka bougie)</li>
<li>At least one rescue airway</li>
<li>All supplies necessary to perform a surgical airway if necessary</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the patient does not require spinal motion restriction/immobilization, the patient should be placed in a “ramped” or “sniffing position”, to improve laryngoscopy and ability to ventilate. The patient’s ear opening should be in the same horizontal plane as the sternal notch.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Pre-Oxygenation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pre-oxygenation should begin as early as possible to minimize the need for positive pressure ventilation after inducing paralysis.
    <ol type="A">
<li>Patients who are spontaneously breathing may be placed on a non-rebreather mask, (optimally) 5 minutes prior to the procedure.</li>
<li>If the patient is ineffectively breathing (pulse oximetry less than 93%), despite the use of a non-rebreather mask, then utilize option c or d below to maximize preintubation pulse oximetry prior to induction.</li>
<li>Patients may also be pre-oxygenated by utilizing a BVM with high flow O<sub>2</sub>. If the patient is spontaneously breathing effectively (pulse oximetry ≥ 93%), refrain from squeezing the bag and allow the patient to continue spontaneous respirations while holding the BVM in place.</li>
<li>If the options listed above do not assure adequate oxygenation (pulse oximetry ≥ 93%), then utilize positive pressure ventilation to assure adequate oxygenation prior to attempting laryngoscopy.</li>
<li>Patients who require ventilatory support should be given at least 4 full (vital capacity) breaths via bag-valve device.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Prior to induction, the clinician will place the patient on continuous capnography and oxygenation throughout the procedure. The patient should also be placed on a nasal cannula / ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitor. O<sub>2</sub> should be delivered through the device at 15 LPM once sedated and left on until the ET tube has been secured. After placing an ET tube, the nasal capnography device should be replaced with the ET tube ETCO<sub>2</sub> detector to assure correct placement.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Pre-Medications</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the setting of actual or suspected head injury, or if there are signs/symptoms of increasing intracranial pressure, the crew may elect to administer the following at 3 minutes prior to intubation:
    <ol type="A">
<li>Lidocaine, 1 mg/kg IVO up to a max dose of 100 mg.</li>
<li>Lidocaine may also be administered as a pre-medication for the asthma patient to suppress the cough reflex.</li>
<li>If a pediatric patient (less than 10 years of age), premedicate with Atropine 0.01 mg/kg IV (minimum dose 0.1 mg).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the patient airway and ventilation is rapidly deteriorating, pre-medication should be deferred.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Paralysis with Sedation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Administer an induction agent followed rapidly by a neuromuscular blocking agent (choose 1):
    <ol type="A">
<li>Etomidate, 0.2 mg/kg IVP – Note: Etomidate may not be repeated after initial dose.</li>
<li>Ativan, 1–2 mg IV</li>
<li>Midazolam, 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IVP in patients without possible or actual hypotension or history of cardiomyopathy</li>
<li>Ketamine, 2 mg/kg IVP should be considered in:
    <ol type="a">
<li>Bronchospastic disease such as asthma</li>
<li>Hypotension due to hypovolemia or distributive shock (sepsis)</li>
<li>CNS excitation or agitation due to drugs</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the patient has unstable vital signs or is at/near cardiopulmonary arrest with jaw clenching or trismus, induction agents should be deferred and an NMB immediately used.</li>
<li>Administer the paralytic agent (succinylcholine, 1–2 mg/kg IVP or Rocuronium 100 mg IV/IO)
    <ol type="A">
<li>Ensure sufficient sedation</li>
<li>Consider the duration of succinylcholine (short) and Rocuronium (long-acting)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Positioning and Placement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cricoid pressure should be initiated after sedation and maintained until ELM is initiated. If it inhibits visualization or device passage, it may be abandoned.</li>
<li>For spinal precautions, remove the front of the c-collar and provide manual head stabilization.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ongoing NMB</h2>
<p>Indications for the use of NMBs in the intubated patient include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return of spontaneous muscle movement</li>
<li>Restless or combative despite adequate analgesia and sedation</li>
<li>Increased oxygen consumption from muscular activity</li>
<li>Ventilator/patient dyssynchrony (gagging or coughing)</li>
<li>Fatigue with increased work of breathing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Post-Intubation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Monitor for heart rate, blood pressure, and restlessness as indicators for additional sedation or analgesia.</li>
<li>Refer to sedation and/or pain management protocol as needed.</li>
</ol>
