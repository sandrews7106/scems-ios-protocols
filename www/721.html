<h2>AEMT</h2>
<ol>
<li>The preferred site for an IV is the hand followed by the forearm and antecubital and is dependent on the patient’s condition and treatment modality</li>
</ol>
<h2>Paramedic</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the event that an IV cannot be established, and the IV is considered critical for the care of the patient, other peripheral sites may be used, i.e.: external jugular, feet, legs</li>
<li>External Jugular Veins should never be the first line attempted unless the patient has no limbs for the initial attempts. INTs SHOULD NOT be used in External Jugular access</li>
<li>The intraosseous site may be used in patients whom IV access cannot be established within 2 attempts or 90 seconds when IV access is critical (REFER TO THE EZ-IO PROCEDURE)</li>
<li>
        Intravenous Fluid Administration:
        <ul>
<li>Any patient having a condition that requires an IV or INT may receive it if the Paramedic deems it necessary. Weigh the transport time against the time it would take to start an IV and make a good decision.</li>
<li>Trauma: Minimize on scene time. IVs are to be started while en route to the hospital unless the patient is pinned in vehicle or a prolonged scene time is unavoidable. Crystalloid Solutions are for trauma patients. The rate is based on patient condition and shall be to maintain the patient’s systolic blood pressure 80–100 mmHg</li>
<li>Medical: INT or IV Normal Saline for chest pain, cardiac arrest or other medical conditions requiring possible IV access. If IV access is all that is needed, the INT is preferred.</li>
</ul>
