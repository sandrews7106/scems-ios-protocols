<h2>Critical Care Paramedic</h2>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
<li>Draining Cerebrospinal Fluid to Control Intracranial Pressure</li>
<li>Diverting excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain is performed with the goal of maintaining intracranial pressure (ICP) at a prescribed level to prevent secondary brain injury. External drainage is performed by way of a catheter placed in the lateral ventricle and connected to an external drainage system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Red Flags</h2>
<ul>
<li>Promptly report sustained (for 15 minutes or more) ICP over 20 mm Hg. Prepare to perform emergency treatment, including CSF drainage, for sustained ICP over 22 mm Hg.</li>
<li>Drain CSF in small increments of 2-5 mL, and do not leave system in drainage position unattended due to risk of overdrainage of CSF and ventricular collapse.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ol>
<li>Supplies</li>
<ul>
<li>Nonsterile gloves</li>
<li>Mask and gown per facility protocol</li>
<li>Leveling device (if not built in to drainage apparatus)</li>
</ul>
<li>Pre-procedure Steps</li>
<ol type="A">
<li>Check care plan and treating clinician orders for ICP parameters, maximum CSF drainage volume, and head of bed elevation.</li>
<li>Review manufacturer instructions for external ventricular drainage system and external transducer in use.</li>
<li>Review patient’s medical history/medical record for:
          <ol type="a">
<li>Catheter type, insertion point, and documented external length</li>
<li>Recent ICP measurements, waveforms, and other assessment findings</li>
<li>Documented volume of CSF drained over previous shift and patient response</li>
<li>Medication and treatment orders for elevated ICP</li>
<li>Allergies (use alternatives, as appropriate)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Verify functioning of patient’s IV catheter, pulse oximeter, and ECG, hemodynamic, and ICP monitors.</li>
<li>Verify correct patient and transducer positioning for optimal ICP measurement:
          <ol type="a">
<li>Verify patient is supine with head in neutral, midline position to avoid jugular compression.</li>
<li>Verify head of bed is elevated to 30° angle, per order, to promote venous drainage.</li>
<li>Verify pressure transducer is level with patient’s foramen of Monro, corresponding to auditory meatus (ear canal).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Follow standard procedure steps as appropriate:
          <ol type="a">
<li>Assess and document patient’s neurological condition before drainage is performed, including any signs/symptoms of increased ICP. Record ICP and waveform.</li>
<li>Turn distal stopcock closed to drainage system and open between patient and transducer to decrease artifact caused by CSF drainage if not already done.</li>
<li>After the ICP waveform has stabilized, record ICP numerical value and print ICP waveform.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Verify CSF drainage is indicated by verifying that the patient’s ICP exceeds prescribed parameters.</li>
<li>Empty drip chamber:
          <ol type="a">
<li>Record current volume of CSF in drip chamber.</li>
<li>Note character, color, and clarity of drainage.</li>
<li>Open drip chamber stopcock open to drainage bag.</li>
<li>After emptying drip chamber, close drip chamber stopcock.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Lower drip chamber to prescribed reference level to facilitate CSF drainage by a combination of intracerebral pressure and gravity.</li>
<li>Turn distal stopcock closed to transducer to discontinue ICP monitoring and open between patient and drainage system to allow CSF to drain into the drip chamber.</li>
<li>Continuously monitor volume of CSF accumulating in drip chamber until prescribed volume (2 mL-5 mL) has accumulated. Do not leave unattended.</li>
<li>When prescribed volume of CSF has drained, turn distal stopcock off to drainage and open between patient and transducer to resume ICP monitoring.</li>
<li>Wait 1 minute for ICP to stabilize and then record ICP numerical value and waveform displayed on monitor to evaluate effectiveness of intervention.</li>
<li>Document volume of CSF in drip chamber and ICP value.</li>
<li>If ICP falls outside prescribed parameters, repeat CSF drainage until prescribed ICP is met or prescribed maximum volume of CSF has been drained.</li>
<li>If ICP falls within prescribed parameters, maintain distal stopcock off to drainage and open between patient and transducer for continuous ICP monitoring.</li>
<li>Notify physician if ICP remains beyond acceptable range despite draining maximum prescribed volume of CSF.</li>
<li>Perform and document postintervention physical assessment.</li>
</ol>
<li>Patient/Family Education</li>
<ol type="A">
<li>Use basic terminology to explain purpose of CSF drainage and ICP monitoring and how patient comfort will be maintained. Answer questions.</li>
<li>Encourage family visitation but explain need to keep lights dimmed and limit noise and outside stimulation, which could increase ICP.</li>
<li>Provide patient education resources, if available, to reinforce verbal education.</li>
</ol>
<li>Post-procedure Steps</li>
<ol type="A">
<li>Perform ongoing neurologic assessments hourly or more frequently as required by the patient’s condition.</li>
<li>Perform additional interventions to restore/maintain normal ICP according to clinician orders, such as by diuretic and corticosteroid administration, pain management, and fluid restriction.</li>
<li>Periodically and after patient repositioning, level transducer with external ear canal or tragus (corresponds to level of foramen of Monro) and zero transducer to maintain accurate ICP measurements.</li>
<li>Wear a mask and sterile gloves and use aseptic nontouch technique when opening closed transducer system (such as when collecting CSF specimens and zeroing transducer) to prevent infection.</li>
<li>Follow standard postprocedure steps as appropriate.</li>
</ol>
<li>Documentation</li>
<ol type="A">
<li>Update patient’s plan of care and medical record, as appropriate. Include:
          <ol type="a">
<li>Date/time CSF was drained</li>
<li>Description of procedure, including total amount of CSF drained, character, color and clarity of drainage, and ICP values before and after drainage</li>
<li>Patient's response to procedure</li>
<li>Any unexpected patient events or outcomes, interventions performed, and whether treating clinician was notified</li>
<li>Patient/family education, such as topics presented, response to education, plan for follow-up education, any communication barriers, and techniques that promoted successful communication</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<li>Care Considerations</li>
<ol type="A">
<li>Catheterization of the brain’s ventricles, the site of CSF production, allows for CSF drainage through an attached external ventricular drainage system.</li>
<li>CSF is produced from arterial blood. It serves to transport products of cellular metabolism and as a cushion to protect the brain.</li>
<li>The average adult produces 25-30 mL of CSF hourly, and approximately 25 mL is contained in the ventricles at any given time.</li>
<li>Catheterization of the lateral ventricle is ideal because these spaces hold the largest volume of CSF.</li>
<li>An external ventricular drainage system is composed of pressure tubing with stopcocks, a drip chamber, and a drainage collection bag.</li>
<li>Increased ICP results from an increase in 1 or more cranial vault components (blood, CSF, and brain tissue) without a decrease in another component, or if a fourth component (such as a tumor, hemorrhage, or edema) is introduced.</li>
<li>The normal ICP range for adults is 0–15 mm Hg. Increased ICP is any measurement above 15 mm Hg, although some degree of elevation is expected in patients with acute brain injury.</li>
<li>Conditions that could require CSF drainage include brain injury or congenital or acquired brain disease resulting in ICP increase.</li>
</ol>
<li>Patient Outcomes</li>
<ol type="A">
<li>The patient’s ICP remains within or is returned to prescribed limits by way of CSF drainage.</li>
<li>The patient does not experience secondary brain injury.</li>
<li>The patient has improvement of neurological function.</li>
</ol>
