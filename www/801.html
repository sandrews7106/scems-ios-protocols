        <p>
            Tennessee law, under legal doctrine known as “implied consent”, allows EMS personnel to treat and
            transport minors when a parent or legal guardian is not available to provide consent IF a medical
            emergency exists. Simply stated, a court will imply that reasonable parents would want someone to
            help their child in their absence if the child develops an emergent medical condition. However, implied
            consent only becomes legally effective after a reasonable effort is made under the circumstances to
            contact a parent or legal guardian to obtain their consent to treat the minor.
        </p>

        <p>
            In non-emergent situations, “mature” minors are generally presumed to be legally competent to give
            consent. Whether or not a minor is “mature” depends upon multiple factors articulated by the
            Tennessee Supreme Court. Since it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the EMS professional to
            adequately assess the factors in the field, it is highly recommended that you obtain the consent of a
            parent or legal guardian before treating or transporting a non-emergent minor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Obtaining the consent of a parent or legal guardian before treating or transporting a minor with either
            an emergent or non-emergent condition is usually not necessary when the minor is married or legally
            emancipated as married or emancipated minors are generally deemed to be legally competent.
