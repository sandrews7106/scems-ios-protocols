    <ol>
      <li>An infant is less than one-year-old</li>
      <li>A child is from one to eight years old</li>
      <li>Remember that few pediatric arrests are primary cardiac events. Most stem from respiratory (airway) problems, dehydration/metabolic, or hypothermia. Ensure that a child that arrests or that is pending arrest is well oxygenated, well hydrated and warm.</li>
      <li>Prognosis is extremely poor for a child that arrests</li>
      <li>Treat children aggressively before they arrest</li>
      <li>When in doubt contact Medical Control</li>
      <li>The use of a length based assessment tape is <strong>required</strong> for all pediatric patients as a guide for medication and equipment sizes</li>
      <li>Remember that with children the Intraosseous drug route is quick to establish and may be easier than gaining IV access</li>
      <li>Children may be effectively ventilated using a BVM. This is the preferred method of ventilation in respiratory or cardiac arrest</li>
    </ol>

    <em>If in doubt always contact Medical Control</em>
