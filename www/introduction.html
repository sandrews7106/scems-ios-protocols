<h1 class="protocol-title">INTRODUCTION TO CLINICAL GUIDELINES</h1>
<p>These Protocol guidelines are provided by State of Tennessee Office of Emergency Medical Services and have been adjusted to fit the needs of Sullivan County EMS. Protocols provide direction for Emergency Medical Services Personnel to render appropriate care for the sick and injured of all ages. It is required that Sullivan County EMS Personnel familiarize themselves with the service approved Protocols and show successful completion by written documentation of competency in the Service Protocols to the Service Medical Director.</p>
<h2>Administrative Notes:</h2>
<ul><li>The EMT and Advanced EMT (AEMT) will assist ALS personnel as requested and/or needed.</li>
<li>The Emergency Medical Responder will function under the current guidelines as stated in the AHA-BLS Healthcare Provider text. Shall also be responsible for other duties as assigned within their Scope of Practice by the AEMT or the Paramedic. Zofran and Epi 1:10,000 may be administered by the AEMT under Paramedic Supervision (updated 5/30/2023). Otherwise, the AEMT may act under approved scope of practice by Sullivan County EMS Medical Direction.</li>
<li>Providers currently licensed as AEMT will continue to function at their current scope of practice until the appropriate “bridge” certification has been obtained through a state accredited program.</li>
<li>The Paramedic will be in charge and will be responsible for all of the actions and or activities as it relates to the Emergency Unit. On the scene of an emergency, the Paramedic will be responsible for patient care. The EMT or AEMT will act within their scope of practice to any request for patient care or maintenance of the unit as directed by the Paramedic. Patient care is limited to acts within their scope of practice as defined by these SOPs. The EMS Personnel are responsible for reviewing all documentation and signing in the required manner</li>
<li>It is the responsibility of the most qualified Paramedic caring for the patient to ensure transmission of all aspects of the patient assessment and care to the responding Emergency Unit or Medical Control.</li>
<li>When reporting a disposition to Medical Control or the responding unit, provide the following minimum information:</li>
<ul><li>Patient’s age and chief complaint</li>
<li>Is the patient stable or unstable, including complete V/S and LOC</li>
<li>Interventions performed</li>
<li>Provide other information as requested.</li></ul>
<li>For each and every call, the first directives are scene safety and body substance isolation precautions.</li>
<li>For any drug administration of procedures outside these Guidelines, the EMS Provider must receive authorization from Medical Control. Paramedics en-route to the scene are not authorized to issue orders.</li>
<li>The minimal equipment required for all patient calls:</li>
<ul><li>When the patient is in close proximity to the unit or Emergency Medical Responder: jump bag, cardiac monitor, and oxygen or other equipment as may be indicated by the nature of the call</li>
<li>When the patient is not in close proximity of the unit or Emergency Medical Responder: the above equipment, stretcher and any other equipment that may be needed as dictated by the nature of the call.</li></ul>
<li>The senior Paramedic has the ultimate responsibility to ensure that all records and reports are properly completed. The patient care report should accurately reflect the clinical activities undertaken. If there is a patient refusal, declination, or dismissal of service at the scene of the incident, the incident report should reflect the details as well as the party or parties responsible for the request to terminate any and all evaluations and treatment.</li>
<li>Although the Guidelines have a numerical order, it may be necessary to change the sequence order or even omit a procedure due to patient condition, the availability of assistance, or equipment. Document your reason for any deviations from protocol.</li>
<li>EMTs and AEMTS are expected to perform their duties in accordance with local, state and federal guidelines in accordance with the State of Tennessee statutes and rules of Tennessee Emergency Services. The Paramedic will work within their scope of practice dependent on available equipment.</li>
<li>Each patient care contact will be recorded on the EMS patient care report as completely and accurately as practical and per agency guidelines. A complete copy of the patient out-of- hospital evaluation(s) and treatment(s) will be given to the emergency department personnel or staff prior to departing from the health care facility. This will ensure proper documentation of the continuity of care. If an emergency is waiting, the report is required to be locked as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours as required by the State rules and regulations.</li>
<li>In potential crime scenes, any movement of the body, clothing, or immediate surroundings should be documented and the on scene law enforcement officer should be notified of such.</li>
<li>All patients should be transported to the most appropriate facility according to the patient or family request or the facility that has the level of care commensurate with the patient’s condition. Certain medical emergencies may require transport to a facility with specialized capability.</li>
<li>Paramedics may transport the patient in a non-emergency status to the hospital. This should be based on the signs and symptoms of the patient, mechanism of injury or nature of illness.</li>
<li>The following refusal situations should be evaluated by a paramedic.</li>
<ul><li>Hypoglycemic patients who have responded to treatment</li>
<li>Any patient refusing transport who has a potentially serious illness or injury</li>
<li>Patients age less than 4 years or greater than 70 years</li>
<li>Chest pain any age or cause</li>
<li>Drug overdose / intoxicated patients</li>
<li>Potentially head injured patients</li>
<li>Psychiatric Disorders</li></ul>
<li>The use of a length based assessment tape is required for all pediatric patients as a guide for medications and equipment sizes. The tape will be utilized on all pediatric patients below the age of 8 years and appropriate for their weight. Any child that is small in stature for their age, you should consider utilizing the length based tape for compiling a complete accurate assessment of the patient. This information will be passed along to the receiving facility and documented in the PCR.</li></ul>
<h2>Clinical Notes:</h2>
<ul><li>A complete patient assessment, vital signs, treatments and continued patient evaluation are to be initiated immediately upon contact with patient and continued until patient care is transferred to a Higher Medical Authority. Refer to Patient Assessment Flow Chart.</li>
<li>The on-going assessment times are considered:</li>
<ul><li>High Priority: Every 3 – 5 minutes	</li>
<li>Low Priority: Every 5 – 15 minutes</li></ul>
<li>EMTs may utilize the following medications: Aspirin, Nitroglycerine, Epinephrine (for Anaphylactic reaction), and assist patient with their own Albuterol or MDI. AEMTs may administer Albuterol, MDI, and Dextrose for hypoglycemia as well as other medications within their scope of practice, (including Zofran and Epinephrine 1:10,000 under Paramedic supervision). Analgesia is not approved for AEMT at SCEMS. Use Nitroglycerine with caution in patients taking erectile dysfunction medications as profound hypotension may occur.</li>
<li>If a glucometer reading of greater than 80 mg/dL and patient is symptomatic; but, the patient has patent gag reflex and mental status, start an INT and administer oral glucose. If a glucometer reading is less than 80 mg/dL and patient is symptomatic with altered level of consciousness, start an IV NS and administer 12.5 – 25 gms of Dextrose. Reassess patient every 5 min, repeat PRN</li>
<li>Note: Any administration of Dextrose must be done through an IV line, not INTs. Normal blood sugar values are 80 – 120 mg/dL.</li>
<li>Blood Glucose and Stroke Screening will be performed on all patients with altered mental status. Glucose should be titrated slowly in order to restore normal levels while avoiding large changes in serum glucose levels. Be aware that elevated glucose levels are detrimental in conditions such as stroke.</li>
<li>Supportive care indicates any emotional and/or physical care including oxygen therapy, repositioning patient, comfort measures and patient family education.</li>
<li>Upon arrival at the receiving hospital, all treatment(s) initiated in the field will be continued until hospital personnel have assumed patient care.</li>
<li>The initial blood pressure MUST be taken manually. If subsequent blood pressures taken by machine vary more than 15 points diastolic, then a manual blood pressure will verify the machine reading.</li>
<li>EMTs may obtain and transmit EKG monitoring tracings and 12 Lead EKGs in the presence of the treating Paramedic. Paramedics ONLY may interpret and make treatment and destination decisions based on the 12 lead EKG.</li>
<li>Indications for football helmet removal:</li>
<ul><li>When a patient is wearing a helmet and not shoulder pads</li>
<li>In the presence of head and/or facial trauma</li>
<li>Patients requiring advanced airway management when removal of the facemask is not sufficient</li>
<li>When the helmet is loose on the patient’s head</li>
<li>In the presence of cardiopulmonary arrest. (The shoulder pads must also be removed) When helmet and shoulder pads are both on the spine is kept in neutral alignment. If the patient is wearing only a helmet or shoulder pads, neutral alignment must be maintained. Either remove the other piece of equipment or pad under the missing piece. All other helmets must be removed in order to maintain spinal alignment.</li></ul></ul>
<h2>Clinical Notes – Airway:</h2>
<ul><li>All EMTs have standing orders for insertion of an approved airway device for patients meeting the indications</li>
<li>Airway maintenance appropriate for the patient’s condition includes any airway maneuver, adjunct, or insertions of tubes that provide a patent airway.</li>
<li>Pulse Oximetry should be utilized for all patients complaining of respiratory distress or chest pain (regardless of source).</li>
<li>Video laryngoscopy should be utilized for all orotracheal intubations.</li>
<li>A filter should be used on all ventilation devices (Bag-valve device, mechanical ventilators).</li>
<li>ETT should be clamped when changing ventilation sources.</li>
<li>Esophageal Intubation detectors and End Tidal CO2 or waveform capnography (preferred) are MANDATORY for all intubations. Reliability may be limited in patients less than 20kg. Use other methods to assist in confirmation.</li>
<li>Use of cervical collars post intubation (BIAD or ET) is recommended to reduce the chance of accidental extubation. This is in addition to the tube securing devices currently in use.</li>
<li>Use of mechanical ventilation may be used in the presence of cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest by appropriate trained Paramedics only. This applies to patients who have an established airway adjunct (ETT or King Airway). The CPAP/BIPAP settings on the ventilator may also be utilized following the respiratory distress protocol.</li></ul>
<h2>Clinical Notes – Cardio Vascular</h2>
<ul><li>In the adult cardiac arrest:</li>
<ul><li>CPR is most effective when done continuously, with minimum interruption. Maintain rate of 110 BPM, a depth of 2 inches and a compression fraction of &gt;80%.</li>
<li>Initiate compressions first, manage airway after effective compressions for two minutes</li>
<li>All IV/IO drugs given are to be followed by a 10 cc NS bolus</li>
<li>Elevate the extremity after bolus when given IV</li>
<li>Consider blind airway devices (King)whenever intubation takes longer than 30 seconds</li>
<li>Apply NC Oxygen 2 – 4 L during initial CPR</li>
<li>Consider use of mechanical CPR device if available</li></ul>
<li>Treat the patient not the monitor</li>
<li>Defibrillation and Synchronized Cardioversion joules are based on the use of the current biphasic monitor.</li>
<li>If a change in cardiac rhythm occurs, provide all treatment and intervention as appropriate for the new rhythm.</li>
<li>In the case of cardiac arrest where venous access is not readily available, paramedics and/or AEMT may use EZ-IO as initial access. Humeral access is preferred in medical conditions.</li>
<li>Current CPR-ACLS guidelines may supersede current guidelines in this document.</li></ul>
<h2>Clinical Notes – IV</h2>
<ul><li>AEMTs and Paramedics have standing orders for precautionary IV and INTs. AEMTs have a standing order for the insertion of an IV or INT under the following guidelines:</li>
<ul><li>The patient must have some indication that they are unstable (see definitions)</li>
<li>Limited to two attempts in one arm only. (Cannulation of legs or neck is not allowed.)</li>
<li>Drug administration will be followed by a minimum of 10cc of fluid to flush the catheter.</li></ul>
<li>Blood Glucose will be performed for all patients with altered mental status</li>
<li>IVs should not be attempted in an injured extremity</li>
<li>TKO (To Keep Open) indicates a flow rate of approximately 50 cc/hr</li>
<li>IVs will not be started in arms with shunts</li>
<li>IVs appropriate for patient’s condition:</li>
<ul><li>if patient is hypotensive, give a bolus of fluid</li>
<li>If patient’s BP is normal run IV TKO or convert to saline lock (INT).</li>
<li>A bolus of fluid is 20 cc/kg for all patients.</li></ul>
<li>For external Jugular IVs attempted by paramedics, IV catheters should be 18 gauge or smaller diameter based on the patient.</li>
<li>Paramedics, when properly equipped and trained, may utilize indwelling access ports such as Port-A-Cath in an EMERGENCY ONLY. This procedure should be done with a Huber needle utilizing sterile technique.</li></ul>
<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
<p>I have taken great care to make certain that doses of medications and schedules of treatment are compatible with generally accepted standards at time of publication. Much effort has gone into the development, production, and proof reading of Protocol Guidelines. Unfortunately, this process may allow errors to go unnoticed or treatments may change between the creation of these protocols and their ultimate use. Please do not hesitate to contact your medical director if you discover any errors, typos, dosage, or medication errors.</p>
<p>I look forward to any questions, concerns, or comments regarding these protocols. I expect all EMS personnel to follow these guidelines, but also to utilize and exercise good judgment to provide the best care for all patients.</p>
